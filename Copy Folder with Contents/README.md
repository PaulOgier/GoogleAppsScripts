# Google Drive Folder Copier Script
A simple and effective Google Apps Script to recursively copy a Google Drive folder, including all its subfolders and files. This is useful for creating backups, duplicating project templates, or archiving folder structures. üìÇ‚û°Ô∏èüìÇ

The script preserves the entire folder hierarchy of the source, recreating it in a new destination folder.

## üöÄ Features
Recursive Copy: Duplicates the entire folder tree, including all nested subfolders.

File Duplication: Copies all files from the source folder and its subfolders to the new destination.

Easy Configuration: Simply set the source folder ID, destination folder ID, and the new folder's name in the script.

Flexible Destination: The destination can be your 'My Drive' root, any specific folder, or even a folder within a Shared Drive.

Progress Logging: Provides detailed logs in the Apps Script execution log, showing which folders and files are being created and copied.

Error Handling: Includes basic try...catch blocks to log errors if a specific file cannot be copied, allowing the script to continue with the remaining items.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
Follow these steps to set up and run the script in your Google account.

Open Google Apps Script: Go to script.google.com and create a New project.

Paste the Code: Delete any default code in the editor and paste the entire copyFolderWithContents.gs script.

Configure the Script: In the code, update the three configuration variables at the top of the copyFolderWithContents function:

JavaScript
// --- Configuration ---
const sourceFolderId = 'REPLACE_WITH_SOURCE_ID'; // The ID of the folder you want to copy
const destinationParentFolderId = 'REPLACE_WITH_DESTINATION_ID'; // Where you want the new folder to be placed. Use 'root' for My Drive.
const newFolderName = 'New Folder Name'; // The name of the new copied folder
// --- End Configuration ---
Tip: To find a folder's ID, open the folder in Google Drive. The ID is the last part of the URL. For example, in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KXyOC6Go6mvcBreQk2qzzp3Pd31S-jl, the ID is 1KXyOC6Go6mvcBreQk2qzzp3Pd31S-jl.

Save the Project: Click the Save project icon (üíæ).

## Run the Function:

From the function dropdown menu at the top, select copyFolderWithContents.

Click the Run button.

Authorize Permissions: The first time you run the script, a pop-up will ask for permission to manage your Google Drive files. You must grant these permissions for the script to work.

Check the Logs: You can view the script's progress by going to View > Executions. This will show you a log of all the folders and files being copied.

When the script finishes, you will find your newly created folder in the destination you specified.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Execution Time: Copying folders with a large number of files or deep subfolder structures can take a long time. Google Apps Scripts have a maximum execution time of 6 minutes for consumer accounts and 30 minutes for Google Workspace accounts. For very large folders, the script may time out.

Ownership: The user running the script will become the owner of the newly created folders and the copied files.

Permissions: The script does not copy the sharing permissions of the original files and folders. All new items will have default permissions.
